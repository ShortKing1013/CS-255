# CS-255

**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

The project we worked on this term was the DriverPass Project. DriverPass is the name of the system and the owner of DriverPass is Liam. He has asked us to build a system to help drivers (especially first timers) to learn real life driving, rules of the road and keep updated on DMV rules and regulations through a system that contains different packages that include things like, course content, testing and diving lessons based on the package that is chosen. 

**What did you do particularly well?**

This class helped me to break down the system and helped me to analyze the different parts of the system. It also showed me LucidChart, a program that I grew to really like. 

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I would probably choose the activity diagrams. I would add more details in them and really break down each step to show the entirety of the flow. 

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

Using the users needs is critical to having the job in the first place. We are hired to help the customers vision of a system come to life and work properly. Interpreting the needs is something that has to be discussed with the user as well and in through detail. What the developer sees for a system may not be exactly what the user has in mind for thier system so communication is a huge asset in the systems design.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

My approach is all in the understanding and breakdown of what the customer is looking for from me and what they want in their system. Setting realistic goals and budget for the project, knowing what I can and cannot complete in the time fram they are looking for as well. Collecting user needs, creating flow diagrams to visualize the system and its users cases too. Communication is a huge thing for me as a developer and keeping the line open with all the correct people to give the system and what the customer wants from it. Designing software is just as much about the people as it is the design.
